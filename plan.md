Aim of the app

A browser-based “Letter Constellations” experience: a hand-painted Iceland/northern-lights scene as a backdrop, with a high-end animated sky (twinkling stars + ribboning aurora).

It's eventually going to be an alphabet learning game where the user writes letters in the sky

Recommended implementation
	•	App shell: statically hosted Vite + TypeScript.
	•	Rendering: WebGPU for the sky effects (stars + aurora) and any post (soft glow/bloom). Keep the painted background as a texture layer.
